# Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and resources for an airline customer satisfaction prediction project. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts customer satisfaction based on various flight details, customer demographics, and service ratings.

## Data Description

The dataset includes information about the airline, flight details, seat comfort, onboard service, food quality, and more. The target variable is "satisfaction," indicating whether a customer is satisfied or not.

## Approach

We explore the data, preprocess it, and engineer relevant features. We then train various machine learning algorithms to predict customer satisfaction, selecting the best-performing model.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input flight details and receive predictions on customer satisfaction in real-time.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test set, enabling airlines to gain insights into customer preferences and improve overall service.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for model training.
3. Deploy the model as a web application using Flask
4. Test the deployed web application using sample flight details for real-time customer satisfaction predictions.

This project is a valuable resource for exploring customer satisfaction prediction in the airline industry. By leveraging machine learning, airlines can enhance customer experience and tailor services to meet customer needs.
